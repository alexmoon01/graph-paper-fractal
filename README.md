# Graph Paper Fractal
A cool fractal that I used to draw as a kid when I was bored and had access to graph paper.

## To Run
The repo is configured to run in pycharm, but really all you need is the script and a venv with `matplotlib` installed. 

## Config
If you want to mess with the initial vectors, you can modify them in the `__init__` method of the `Fractal` object. No config file because I wrote this in like 2 hours lol
